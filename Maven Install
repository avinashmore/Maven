At this point of time I am using mac os sierra. 

Step 1 : Check if Maven is gloabally already installed or not?

Command: mvn --version
Explaination: This command returns the version of maven. 
As I am checking if Maven is installed or not, if  
Maven was installed then it would return something other than this command doesn't exist. 
In my case it is not installed. 

Step 2	: Download Maven and unzip it.

You can download it from https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi
After downloading just unzip it.


Step 3	:  Move it to some location

Move it to the location where you have all the installables.
It's not necessary to do so but having all installables at one 
location is good practice.
I have moved it to ~ i.e home.

Step 4	:	Set System variables

This basically sets 2 system variable in particular
PATH - 
M3_HOME - Folder where maven is located.

Commands: 
export M3_HOME=/Users/{user-name}/apache-maven-3.3.9/
export PATH=$PATH:/Users/{user-name}/apache-maven-3.3.9/bin/

Step 5	: Check if maven is installed or not?

command: mvn --version
result: Apache Maven 3.3.9 {and lot more stuff}

Step 6	: Close the terminal and run the command from step 5 again

results: -bash: mvn: command not found
This happens because what we did in step 4 was only for that 
particular session. if you want it to persist even after terminal 
was closed? 

Then modify the ~/.bash_profile file

Step 7	: 	Modify the ~/.bash_profile file.

open the  ~/.bash_profile and add the two command from step 4
save the file.
close the terminal.

Step 8	:	Reopen the terminal again and check if Maven is globally 
		accesssible or not

command: mvn -- version

yes! it's working now.
