Maven: 

POM: Project object model
Maven uses pom.xml to determine the dependencies.
Maven first looks in the local maven repository for the depenedancies. (Where is local maven repository?)

If Maven doesn't find the specified version dependancies in the local repository, 
then maven looks for other public maven repositories on the internet.
Maven build the whole tree of dependacies. 

Every maven project goes through some phases for the build process. 

Default maven build phases: 
1.	Validate
2.	Compile
3.	Test
4.	Package
5.	Integration Test
6.	Verify
7.	Install
8. 	Deploy

If you want to achive some kind of custom behavior while building 
the maven project you can write the scripts for it.
